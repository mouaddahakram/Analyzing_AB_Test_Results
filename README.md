## Table of Contents
- *Part I - Probability*
- *Part II - A/B Test*
- *Part III - Regression*

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that we get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Quick Start
### Packages needed 
> You will need to call many libraries for this project, and they are the following :
> * `NumPy` 
> * `Pandas`
> * `Random`
> * `Matplotlib`

In order to get the same results shown in the code, you will need to include the line below ( *preferably if you joing it with same cell of the libraries*):
> random.seed(42)
